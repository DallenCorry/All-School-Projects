The Capstone Project for CSCI 2906 at Southwest Technical College

This project, known as OddJob is a community job board for posting small, local jobs.

To use: download the files and put them in a new javafx program in your favorite IDE. 

If using IntelliJ:
- File > New > Project > JavaFX Project.
- replace the src file with the downloaded src file.
- put "jobs.dat" and "users.dat" into the same folder as the project, NOT in src.
- run the main found in driver.java.
